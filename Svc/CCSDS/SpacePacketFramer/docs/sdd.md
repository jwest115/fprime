# Svc::CCSDS::SpacePacketFramer

The `Svc::CCSDS::SpacePacketFramer` is an implementation of the [FramerInterface](../../../Interfaces/docs/sdd.md) for the CCSDS [Space Packet Protocol](https://public.ccsds.org/Pubs/133x0b2e1.pdf).

It receives user data on its input port and constructs a CCSDS Space Packet. Please refer to the CCSDS [Space Packet Protocol specification (CCSDS 133.0-B-2)](https://public.ccsds.org/Pubs/133x0b2e1.pdf) for details on the packet format.

The `Svc::CCSDS::SpacePacketFramer` is typically used upstream of a component that adds transfer frame headers, such as the `Svc::CCSDS::TmFramer`. It encapsulates user data into a Space Packet, adding the necessary header fields.

## Configuration
The `Svc::CCSDS::SpacePacketFramer` requires an Application Process Identifier (APID) for the Space Packets it generates. This APID is typically provided during instantiation or configuration. It also uses a sequence count, which is managed per APID via the `getApidSeqCount` port.

## CCSDS Header Fields

For each Space Packet generated, the `Svc::CCSDS::SpacePacketFramer` will populate the CCSDS Space Packet Primary Header fields as follows:

| Field | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Version Number | 000 | As per protocol 4.1.3.2 |
| Packet Type | 0 (Telemetry) | SpacePacketFramer emits reporting packets only (no commanding), as per 4.1.3.3.2 |
| Secondary Header Flag | 0 | F Prime does not use secondary headers formally |
| Application Process Identifier (APID) | Uses value passed in the `context` argument | Project APIDs are defined in `config/ComCfg.fpp` |
| Sequence Flags | `0b11` (Unsegmented) | Unsegmented user data, FÂ´ data fits in a single packet |
| Packet Sequence Count | Incremented for each packet, unique count per APID | Managed externally by a [`Svc::CCSDS::ApidManager`](../../ApidManager/docs/sdd.md) |
| Packet Data Length | Set to the length of the passed in data | Calculated based on the length of the data received on `dataIn` |

## Port Descriptions

| Kind | Name | Port Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Input (sync) | dataIn | Svc.ComDataWithContext | Port to receive user data to be framed into a Space Packet |
| Output | dataOut | Svc.ComDataWithContext | Port to output the constructed Space Packet |
| Output | bufferAllocate | Fw.BufferGet | Port to allocate buffers for the outgoing Space Packet |
| Output | bufferDeallocate | Fw.BufferSend | Port to deallocate buffers after the Space Packet is sent |
| Output | getApidSeqCount | CCSDS.ApidSequenceCount | Port to retrieve the current sequence count for a given APID |
