# Svc::CCSDS::TmFramer

The `Svc::CCSDS::TmFramer` is an implementation of the [FramerInterface](../../../Interfaces/docs/sdd.md) for the CCSDS [TM Space Data Link Protocol](https://ccsds.org/Pubs/132x0b3.pdf). 

It receives payload data (such as a Space Packet or a VCA_SDU) on input and produces a TM frame on its output port as a result. Please refer to the CCSDS [TM specification (CCSDS 132.0-B-3)](https://ccsds.org/Pubs/132x0b3.pdf) for details on the frame format and protocol.

The `Svc::CCSDS::TmFramer` is designed to work in the common F Prime telemetry stack, receiving data from an upstream [`Svc::ComQueue`](../../../ComQueue/docs/sdd.md) and passing frames to a [Communications Adapter](../../../Interfaces/docs/sdd.md), such as a Radio manager component or [`Svc::ComStub`](../../../ComStub/docs/sdd.md), for transmission on the wire. It is commonly coupled with the [`Svc::CCSDS::SpacePacketFramer`](../../SpacePacketFramer/docs/sdd.md) to wrap CCSDS Space Packets into TM frames.

## Internals

The TM protocol specifies a fixed frame size. This can be configured in the `config/ComCfg.fpp` file.

The `Svc::CCSDS::TmFramer` uses an internal (member) buffer to hold the fixed size frame. The buffer **must** be returned to the TmFramer via the `dataReturnIn` port once it has been used or consumed. When the buffer returns to the TmFramer it will reuse the buffer for the next frame. Should a component want to use the frame data past the time it is returned to the TmFramer, data should be copied before the original buffer is returned to the TmFramer via the `dataReturnIn` port. 

## Usage Examples

The `Svc::CCSDS::TmFramer` component, as well as the rest of the CCSDS communications stack, is used in the [`Ref/`](https://github.com/nasa/fprime/tree/devel/Ref) example application. It is also generated by the `fprime-util new --deployment` command.

## CCSDS Header Fields

For each frame generated, the `Svc::CCSDS::TmFramer` will populate the CCSDS TM Primary Header fields as follows:

| Field | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Transfer Frame Version Number | 0 | As per protocol 4.1.2.2 |
| Spacecraft ID | Configured in `config/ComCfg.fpp` | Set in the project configuration |
| Virtual Channel ID | Uses value passed in the `context` argument (defaults to 0) | Set by an upstream component |
| Operational Control Field Flag | 0 | Unsupported |
| Master Channel Frame Count | Incremented for each frame | Managed internally by TmFramer |
| Virtual Channel Frame Count | Incremented for each frame | Managed internally by TmFramer. One TmFramer instance can only keep count of a single VCID. |
| Transfer Frame Secondary Header Flag | 0 | F Prime does not formally use secondary headers |
| Synchronization Flag | 0 | 0 as Packets are inserted |
| Packet Order Flag | 0 | As per protocol 4.1.2.7.4 |
| Segment Length Identifier | 0b11 | As per protocol 4.1.2.7.5 |
| First Header Pointer | 0 | F Prime packets are limited in length and always sent in a single frame, aligned to the start of the frame. |

## Port Descriptions

| Kind | Name | Port Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| sync input | dataIn | Svc.ComDataWithContext | Receives data to frame, in a Fw::Buffer with optional context |
| output | dataOut | Svc.ComDataWithContext | Outputs framed data with optional context |
| output | dataReturnOut | Svc.ComDataWithContext | Returns ownership of the incoming Fw::Buffer to its sender once framing is handled |
| sync input | dataReturnIn | Svc.ComDataWithContext | Receives buffer from a deallocate call in a ComDriver component |
| sync input | comStatusIn | Fw.SuccessCondition | Receives general status from downstream component indicating readiness for more input |
| output | comStatusOut | Fw.SuccessCondition | Indicates the status of framer for receiving more data |
